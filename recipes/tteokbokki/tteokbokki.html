    <h3>Ingredients for 4 servings</h3>
    <h4>Rice cakes (or use 1 pound store-bought rice cakes)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups sweet rice flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1&frac12; cup boiling water</li>
        <li>sesame oil, for greasing</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Tteokbokki</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups water, plus more for soaking, if needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dashi powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes), or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)</li>
        <li>&frac12; lb fish cakes</li>
        <li>2 hard-boiled eggs</li>
        <li>shredded mozzarella cheese, optional</li>
        <li>1 green onion, cut into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the rice cakes (alternatively, if using store-bought, jump to step 5): In a medium, microwave-safe bowl, combine the rice flour, salt, and boiling water and mix until well-combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, leaving an opening for steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Microwave the dough for 2 minutes. Knead the dough with a spatula, cover again with the plastic wrap, and microwave for another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Grease a flat surface with sesame oil. Pound and knead the dough with a pestle until the dough is smooth and stretchy, about 5 minutes (if you don’t have a pestle, you can use another heavy object covered in oiled plastic wrap).</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Coat the dough in sesame oil, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out. Working one at a time, roll each portion into a log, then cut into bite-size pieces and shape each piece as desired. The most common shape for tteokbokki are cylinders, or you can make fun shapes like hearts. Coat the rice cakes in more sesame oil and spread them out so they don’t touch and stick together, then repeat with the remaining dough. You should have about 1 pound. If not using immediately, the rice cakes can be stored in a zip-top freezer bag or wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and frozen for up to three months.</li>
        <li>Make the tteokbokki: If using frozen rice cakes, soak in room temperature water for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the water to a medium skillet and bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the dashi powder and stir until completely dissolved, 1–2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the gochugaru, sugar, gochujang, fish cakes, and rice cakes to the broth. Stir until the gochujang and gochugaru are well-incorporated, then simmer until the broth has reduced to a thick sauce and the rice cakes are soft and squishy, about 5 minutes. During the last 2 minutes of cooking, add the hard-boiled eggs, mozzarella, if using, and green onions. Cover the pan and cook until the cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat and serve warm.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
